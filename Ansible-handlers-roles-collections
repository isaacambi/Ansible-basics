ANSIBLE HANDLERS, ROLES AND COLLECTIONS

1. You've been tasked with automating the configuration of Juniper devices 
in your network, to achieve this, you need to install the appropriate Ansible
 Collection that provides Juniper-specific modules and roles.

Which of the following commands would you use to install the Juniper-specific
 collection for network automation?

a. ansible-galaxy collection install network.juniper

b. ansible-galaxy retrieve collection network.juniper

c. ansible-galaxy collection get network.juniper

d. ansible-galaxy get collection network.juniper

Ans = ansible-galaxy collection install network.juniper

2. You've installed the amazon.aws collection and now you need to create an EC2 instance using a playbook.

Given the following playbook snippet, identify the missing line that correctly imports the amazon.aws collection.
---
- hosts: localhost
  [MISSING LINE HERE]
  tasks:
    - name: Launch an EC2 instance
      ec2_instance:
        name: my-instance
        region: us-west-1

a. collections: [amazon.aws]

b. collection: [amazon.aws]

c. collections=[amazon.aws]

d. collection=[amazon.aws]
solutions
collections: [amazon.aws] is the correct way to import the amazon.aws collection.

3. You are given access to a lab environment with a machine (i.e student-node) that
 has Ansible installed. On this machine, there's a /home/bob/playbooks/requirements.yml
 file that lists several collections required for a project. Your task is to install all
 the collections listed in the /home/bob/playbooks/requirements.yml file using the correct command.

You can use the following command to install all collections listed in the requirements.yml file.

cd playbooks/
ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.yml

4. You've been informed about a new Ansible Collection named networking_tools under the 
namespace company_xyz. This collection contains specialized modules for network automation.
 You need to write a playbook that installs this collection and then uses a custom module 
named configure_vlan from it to set up VLAN 10 with the name Admin_VLAN.
placeholders in this playbook.

Please note that, you need not to run this playbook for testing, just make the required
 changes to fill the placeholders correctly.

Update the playbook /home/bob/playbooks/playbook.yml as below:

---
- hosts: localhost
  tasks:
    - name: Install the networking_tools collection
      ansible.builtin.ansible_galaxy_collection:
        name: company_xyz.networking_tools
        source: https://galaxy.ansible.com

- hosts: switches
  collections:
    - company_xyz.networking_tools
  tasks:
    - name: Configure VLAN 10
      configure_vlan:
        vlan_id: 10
        vlan_name: Admin_VLAN

5. Given the following sample Ansible playbook /update_web_server_config.yml
- name: Update web server configuration
  hosts: webservers
  tasks:
    - name: Copy web server configuration file
      copy:
        src: /path/to/webserver.conf
        dest: /etc/webserver/webserver.conf
      notify: Restart web server


Which of the following handler implementations will correctly restart
 the web server when the configuration file is changed?

a.

handlers:
  - name: Restart web servers
    service:
      name: webserver
      state: restarted



b.

handlers:
  - name: Restart server
    service:
      name: webserver
      state: restarted



c.

handlers:
  - name: Restart
    service:
      name: webserver
      state: restarted



d.

handlers:
  - name: Restart web server
    service:
      name: webserver
      state: restarted






Complete the playbook located at /home/bob/playbooks/playbook.yml to correctly 
install the networking_tools collection and utilize the configure_vlan module. 
You just need to fill the 

solution
Following handler implementation will correctly restart the web server when the configuration file is changed.

handlers:
  - name: Restart web server
    service:
      name: webserver
      state: restarted

6. You are given access to a lab environment with a server (i.e student-node). 
On this server, you have a playbook named /home/bob/ansible_lab/handler_test.yml.
 This playbook contains multiple tasks that notify the same handler. Your task is to
 run the playbook and answer below question.


How many times will the handler be executed during the playbook run?

a) Once for each notifying task.

b) Only once, at the end of the playbook run.

c) Once for each changed task.

d) The handler will not be executed.


7. You have a handler named Restart Network Service. Which of the following task implementations
 correctly notifies this handler when the network configuration file is modified?


a.

- name: Update network configuration
  copy:
    src: /path/to/network.conf
    dest: /etc/network/network.conf



b.

- name: Update network configuration
  copy:
    src: /path/to/network.conf
    dest: /etc/network/network.conf
  notify: Restart Network Service



c.

- name: Update network configuration
  copy:
    src: /path/to/network.conf
    dest: /etc/network/network.conf
  handler: Restart Network Service



d.

- name: Update network configuration
  copy:
    src: /path/to/network.conf
    dest: /etc/network/network.conf
  trigger: Restart Network Service

solution
Following task implementation correctly notifies this handler when the network configuration file is modified.

- name: Update network configuration
  copy:
    src: /path/to/network.conf
    dest: /etc/network/network.conf
  notify: Restart Network Service
